The depreciation value of any product bought by businesses can be utilised in the tax returns for the next year. 

The depreciated values acts a loss of income. Let's assume : 

You earn Rs. 100 
With a tax rate of 30% you are liable to deposits Rs. 30 as tax return.
If you have a depreciating asset worth Rs. 80 (with a depreciation rate of 20%), you can reduce this (Rs 16) from your income, hence Rs. 84 is your final income. 

Tax on Rs. 84 is Rs. 25.2, hence saving you Rs. 4.8

This is what the app does for you.
